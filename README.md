# Chore Share
### Summary
Chore Share helps users with roommates keep track of the chores they share with each other in a simple application. Users can add & delete roomies and chores as well as mark chores "Done" or Undo if the chore was in fact not completed. Each chore added will correspond to the roomie it's assigned to.

This portion is the React front-end for viewing and editing information using the [Chore Share API](https://github.com/Jadedtofu/chore-share-api)
